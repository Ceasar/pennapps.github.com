<h3>What's a hackathon?</h3>

<p>A hackathon is when people who are excited about programming come together for a weekend and collaborate to build cool things. Entrepreneurs, designers, and developers work in teams to create hacks and apps for web or mobile platforms - in our case, these creators are university students.</p>

<h3>Who can participate?</h3>

<p>PennApps is open to all current undergraduate and graduate students, including freshmen! You don't have to attend the University of Pennsylvania; you don't have to be a computer science major or even an engineering student, though you should have some coding experience. You aren't required to have ever attended a hackathon before: we will have tech talks beforehand so you can ramp up quickly. You can come with a team or come alone - there will be a place for you.</p>

<h3>Do I have to go to Penn?</h3>

<p>No - in fact, we'd love to have you here no matter where you're from! In fact, if you need assistance figuring out how to get here, shoot us an email and we'll help you coordinate transportation.</p>

<h3>What if I'm a noob?</h3>

<p>Don't worry, we're all here to learn something new. There will be plenty of people trying something for the first time, and many people who will be willing to help you out.</p>

<h3>Do I have to be there the entire time?</h3>

<p>Nope, you're allowed to get sleep :) However, all your coding and work must be done at the site of the competition.</p>

<h3>Will there be food?</h3>

<p>Yes. The only thing you need to worry about is coding; let us take care of the rest. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and plenty of drinks (including energy drinks) will be provided throughout the competition at no cost to participants. We will be providing vegetarian options as well. If you have a specific food allergy or other specific need, contact us and we'll try to find a way to make it work for you.</p>

<h3>Where is it and how do I get there?</h3>

<p>PennApps 2011 will be held in the Quad (3650 Spruce St.) at the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.</p>

<h4>From NYC:</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>The first, and most common, option is to travel by bus. Both Bolt Bus and Megabus have regular buses between NYC and Philly. The trip is about two hours and many buses offer free wi-fi.</p></li>
<li><p>You may also choose to use Amtrak, which will cost anywhere from $30 to $200 dollars one way. The Acela Express, while on the high end of that price range, does provide free wi-fi for the duration of your trip. Prices can increase by up to $100 as the date nears, so we suggest you buy tickets in advance. The trip takes an hour and a half.</p></li>
<li><p>Another option is to take NJ Transit to Trenton, and then transfer to SEPTA to Philadelphia on the Trenton Line. This takes about three hours and costs about $30 each way, depending whether you're traveling peak/off-peak.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Lowdown</strong>: Megabus is cost effective and our top recommendation. Amtrak may cost ten times more, and you will only save an hour of travel time. If you like a walk on the wild side, or don't know exactly when on Friday you're going to leave, transferring from NJ Transit to SEPTA is more time-flexible and may fit your needs.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>From Boston:</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>By bus, the trip is six to seven hours. Many buses in the Megabus fleet have free wi-fi. Additionally, Greyhound offers trips to Philadelphia in the $30 price range.</p></li>
<li><p>If the idea of spending that much time in a bus doesn't suit you, you can spring for Amtrak, which ranges from $50 to over $150 each way. The Acela Express offers free wi-fi for the duration of the trip, and can cost as little as the standard Northeast Regional train if you buy in advance. Either way, ticket prices can increase by $100 as the date nears, so if you choose Amtrak, buy early. The trip takes about five to six hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Another option is to buy a plane ticket - again, buy early, and you'll cut costs. Tickets can be had for about $100 round trip, and the flight only takes an hour. We suggest using Hipmunk or a similar service to compare flights.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Lowdown</strong>: It really depends on whether you would rather pay an extra $40-$100 dollars or sit on a bus for an additional 12 hours.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>From Pittsburgh:</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>By bus, the trip is five to six hours. Both Megabus and Greyhound tickets are available, and cost approximately $40 dollars each way.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't mind springing for air fare, plane tickets will cost approximately $165 per passenger round trip. The flight is a little over an hour. We suggest using Hipmunk or a similar service to compare flights.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Lowdown</strong>: The choice is yours: pay over $100 and cut your travel time by 10 hours, or cut costs by taking the bus.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Once you get to Philadelphia?</h4>

<p>If you're coming by train, you'll step out at 30th Street Station. Walk, taxi, or subway a few blocks to reach the Quad at 3650 Spruce Street.</p>
